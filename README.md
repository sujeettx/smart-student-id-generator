# 📛 Smart Student ID Generator

The Smart Student ID Generator is a simple yet powerful React-based web app that allows students to register their information, preview their ID card in real-time, and switch between different ID templates. It uses local storage to retain the latest submitted student data and displays a responsive preview of the ID card with uploaded photo, personal details, and more.

## 🧠 Overview

This app is designed for generating stylish student ID cards with just a few inputs. It allows:

- 📝 Student registration with personal details & photo upload
- 👀 Real-time preview of the ID card after form submission
- 🎨 Template switching support (multiple themes/layouts)
- 💾 LocalStorage integration for retaining data on reload

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **React** – Frontend library
- **React Router DOM** – For routing between form and preview
- **React Toastify** – For displaying success notifications
- **Tailwind CSS** – For styling the app responsively
- **LocalStorage** – For persisting form data locally
